With NIMWAVE, you can build TUI programs for the terminal, the desktop (via OpenGL/GLFW) and the web (via web assembly). Pedantic nerds love to point out that TUI stands for *text* user interface, not terminal. NIMWAVE is what happens when one of those nerds writes a library. Let's decouple TUIs from the terminal by running them where the normies are.

To get started, clone [the starter project](https://github.com/ansiwave/nimwave_starter) and run the commands in its README.

Documentation for this library is coming soon...
